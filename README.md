# PortfolioProjects

Within this project I utilized postgreSQL to analyze World Population data from 2022 to 2023. I completed basic queries involving GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and WHERE statements, along with subqueries, to provide potentially beneficial KPI's regarding the data set. Examples include, which countries have a growth rate that is higher than the average total growth rate, what is the difference between population in 2022 vs 2023 in Asian countries, and which countries had a decrease in population from 2022 to 2023.
